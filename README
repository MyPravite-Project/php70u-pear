Upgrading to new versions of PEAR
=================================

Currently no versioned archive of the installer ".phar" archives is
available from upstream; only a single unversioned .phar at the
http://pear.php.net/install-pear-nozlib.phar URL.

This .phar link is not always updated when new versions of PEAR are
released.  When upgrading:

1) download http://pear.php.net/install-pear-nozlib.phar

2) check that it matches the expected version (there will be
references to "PEAR-1.5.4.tar" in the 1.5.4 installer)

3) submit the new .phar to the setaside repo as normal, ensuring
a versioned name is used:

  $ curl http://pear.php.net/install-pear-nozlib.phar \
        > install-pear-nozlib-1.5.4.phar
  $ make upload FILES=install-pear-nozlib-1.5.4.phar

Hopefully in the future a versioned archive of the installer .phars
will be available which will simplify this process.
